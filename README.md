# Memory_game-HTML-Javascript-
 using HTML and JavaScript (and a bit of CSS), built a 1-player game of Memory!

Here are the rules of Memory:
- 4 pairs of cards (8 cards total) are placed faced down. The faces of the cards are the images listed at the top of the JS file. (There are more images than you need.)
- The player selects two cards by clicking on them. When the player clicks on a face-down card, it flips over, revealing the front.
- Once two cards are selected, then after a 1-second delay:
  * If the cards match, the cards are removed from the board.
  * If the cards don't match, the cards are flipped back over.
- Once all cards are removed from the board, the player wins.

Your game should keep track of how many total pairs the user flipped over (so a perfect score would be 4). 
This score should be displayed at the completion of the game.
